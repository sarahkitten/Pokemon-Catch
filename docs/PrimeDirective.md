## Prime directive: Important instructions for all changes

Read this file and the feature plan before completing any task.

Only complete one SMALL task at a time.  Do not move on until all of these rules have been followed and the user has prompted you to continue.

Whenever making changes, follow these rules:
- Any time a significant change is made, consider whether a unit test should be added.  If so, add the unit test.
- Any time a significant change is made OR a unit test is added, run all unit tests.  If any are failing, fix them.
- Any time any change is made, check the file for problems.  DO NOT move on until you have checked the file and found no problems.
- Any time a task in the feature plan is completed (after all tests and files have been checked), update the feature plan to reflect that.
- Any time you decide to do something differently than is laid out in the feature plan, update the feature plan. 
- Any time a task is completed, update the feature plan to indicate the next small task that should be completed.
